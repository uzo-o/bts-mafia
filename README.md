# BTS Mafia
a text-based version of the mafia game with BTS members as users

## Description
BTS Mafia runs an 8-player game of mafia featuring members from the K-Pop band
BTS as the other 7 players. You can be assigned a random role to play (police
officer, doctor, civilian) or choose one yourself. You may not be the mafia.
Each mode of gameplay features different dialogues spoken by different players,
and lines are randomly assigned every time the program runs. There is also a 
unique host of ways the mafia can choose to get rid of a player.

### Police Officer Mode
You can pick a suspicious player and confirm whether or not they're the mafia.
Keep in mind that the players may not agree with you when it is time to vote.

### Doctor Mode
You can save a player from the mafia's wrath. They will be revived if the mafia
killed them that night, or simply protected otherwise.

### Civilian Mode
You can interact more directly with the players. The outcome of the dialogue
is swayed by your input.
